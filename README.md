## Cundle

As iOS/Mac has more and more great libraries like ASIHTTPRequest, RestKit and etc. There's no good package management tool for it. Cundle is inspired by the simple but useful vim bundler `vundle` and aims to provide a tool with minimized functions to manage these packages.

The command line is written in bash. No need for compile.

## Usage

	$ cundle

	Cundle - the Obj-C Library Manager
	
	Usage:
	    cundle help                    Show this message
	    cundle install                 Download and install all libs defined in ./Cundlefile
	    cundle install <lib>           Download and install a <lib>
	    cundle update                  Use the latest code for libs defined in ./Cundlefile
	    cundle update <lib>            Use the latest code for <lib> from git
	    cundle ls                      List installed libs
	    cundle remove <lib>            Remove a <lib>
	
	Example:
	    cundle install RestKit/RestKit Install latest version of RestKit
	    cundle remove RestKit/RestKit  Remove RestKit under SharedLib

Run the following command under your project root. This will add ASIHttpRequest to SharedLib/asi-http-request. And by default, this command will also fetch all submodules or cundles defined inside the cundle.

	$ cundle install pokeb/asi-http-request

Full git url can also be used.

	$ cundle install git@github.com:ashchan/macruby-keychain-wrapper.git

To list all installed cundles
	
	$ cundle ls
	Installed libs under /Users/jyo/Examples/SharedLib:
	✓ enormego/EGOImageLoading
	✓ pokeb/asi-http-request

To remove an installed bundle. And you need to remove that dependency from you Xcode project manually.

	$ cundle remove RestKit/RestKit

If you have a `Cundlefile` at the project root, use `cundle` to install all cundles defined in the `Cundlefile`.

	$ cat Cundlefile
	cundle "pokeb/asi-http-request"
	cundle "RestKit/RestKit"
	cundle "enormego/EGOImageLoading"
	cundle "https://bitbucket.org/jaredhobbs/pysiri.git"
	
	$ cundle install
	Cloning into '/Users/jyo/Examples/SharedLib/asi-http-request'...
	Cloning into '/Users/jyo/Examples/SharedLib/EGOImageLoading'...
	Submodule 'EGOCache' (git://github.com/enormego/EGOCache.git) registered for path 'EGOCache'
	Cloning into 'EGOCache'...
	Submodule path 'EGOCache': checked out '8b7c7ecfc8fad396b6547ad3fef085713644f794'

Use `cundle update` to update your all your cundles or `cundle update RestKit/RestKit` for just RestKit.

## Install

Download and install cundle
	
	$ git clone git://github.com/rjyo/cundle.git ~/.cundle

To activate cundle, you need to source it from your bash shell

	$ . ~/.cundle/cundle.sh

Add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc (if you use oh-my-zsh like me) file to have it automatically source upon login.

## Limitations & Future plan

* Not able to use a certain commit, tag or branch. It just pulls the latest source.
* `cundle` is still at its alpha stage, but I'll make it better as I can. [Shoot me an email](mailto:jyo.rakuraku@gmail.com) if you have any question.
